  abstract  = {Blood Pressure (BP) is one of the four primary vital signs indicating the status of the body’s vital (lifesustaining) functions. BP is difﬁcult to continuously monitor using a sphygmomanometer (i.e. a blood pressure cuff), especially in everyday-setting. However, other health signals which can be easily and continuously acquired, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), show some similarities with the Aortic Pressure waveform. Based on these similarities, in recent years several methods were proposed to predict BP from the PPG signal. Building on these results, we propose an advanced personalized data-driven approach that uses a threelayer deep neural network to estimate BP based on PPG signals. Different from previous work, the proposed model analyzes the PPG signal in time-domain and automatically extracts the most critical features for this speciﬁc application, then uses a variation of recurrent neural networks called Long-ShortTerm-Memory (LSTM) to map the extracted features to the BP value associated with that time window. Experimental results on two separate standard hospital datasets, yielded absolute errors mean and absolute error standard deviation for systolic and diastolic BP values outperforming prior works.},

  abstract = {Objective. In this study, we aimed to estimate blood pressure (BP) from in-ear photoplethysmography (PPG). This novel implementation provided an unobtrusive and steady way of recording PPG, whereas previous PPG measurements were mostly performed at the wrist, ﬁnger, or earlobe. Methods. The time between forward and reﬂected PPG waves was very short at the ear site. To minimize errors introduced by feature extraction, a multi-Gaussian decomposition of in-ear PPG was performed. Both hand-crafted and whole-based features were extracted and the best combination of features was selected using a backward-search wrapper method and evaluated by the Akaike information criteria. Hemodynamic parameters such as compliance and inertance were estimated from a four-element Windkessel (WK4) model, which was used to pre-classify PPG signals and generate different BP estimation algorithms. Calibration was done by using previous measurements from the same class. To validate this novel approach, 53 subjects were recruited for a one-month follow-up study, and 17 subjects were recruited for a two-month follow-up study. Calibrated systolic BP estimation accuracy was signiﬁcantly improved with inertance-based pre-classiﬁcation, while diastolic BP showed less improvement. Results. With proper feature selection, pre-classiﬁcation and calibration, we have achieved a mean absolute error of 5.35 mmHg for SBP estimation, compared to 6.16 mmHg if no preclassiﬁcation was carried out. The performance did not deteriorate in two months, showing a decent BP trend-tracking ability. Conclusion. The study demonstrated the feasibility of in-ear PPG to reliably measure BP, which represents an important technological advancement in terms of unobtrusiveness and steadiness.},

  abstract = {Though small wrist-type blood pressure (BP) measurement devices using simple sensors have recently been developed, they lack accuracy and require the input of personal user data. To miniaturize BP measurement devices, this study proposes the use of algorithms that can calculate BP using sensors that utilize only two photoplethysmographies (PPGs), without the need for electrocardiograms. To reduce the error of indirect BP measurement, speciﬁc values representing individual blood vessel conditions are improved via the application of an algorithm developed using mean arterial pressure and PPG phase diﬀerence. To reduce the error that occurs when measuring BP using PPG, a speciﬁc value algorithm used to develop a miniaturized BP measuring device using two PPGs is proposed along with a new model. The developed ultra-small PPG measuring device uses a reﬂective photoplethysmography measurement circuit. This is presented as a PPG-only model that deviates from the method of additionally linking existing electrocardiography (ECG). The measurement device developed in this study is compared with the air-pressurized automatic BP measurement device in terms of the BP measurement value; the result of maintaining the error stably at 5\% is derived to prove the superiority of the algorithm.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, the number of patients with hypertension has increased. Hypertension is an invisible killer. Long-term hypertension can cause a series of cardiovascular diseases such as angina pectoris, stroke, and heart failure. Therefore, early evaluation and grade assessment of blood pressure (BP) are essential to human health. The seventh report of the National Joint Committee for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of Hypertension in the United States (JNC7) classified BP levels into normotension (NT), prehypertension (PHT) and hypertension (HT). In this paper, we adopted a deep learning model (ResNet18) based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and the Hilbert Transform (HT) to predict the risk level of BP only using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. We collected 582 data records from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care database (MIMIC), and each file contained arterial BP signals as the labels for inputs and the corresponding PPG signals as the inputs. Besides, the last fully connected layer of the model was initialized. We conducted three classification experiments: HT vs. NT, HT vs. PHT, and (HT + PHT) vs. NT, the F1 score of these three classification experiments is 88.03\%, 70.94\%, and 84.88\%, respectively. A quick and accessible noninvasive BP evaluation method was offered to low- and middle-income countries.},

  abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) is a direct indicator of hypertension, a dangerous and potentially deadly condition. Regular monitoring of BP is thus important, but many people have aversion towards cuff-based devices, and their limitation is that they can only be used at rest. Using just a photoplethysmogram (PPG) to estimate BP is a potential solution investigated in our study. We analyzed the MIMIC III database for high-quality PPG and arterial BP waveforms, resulting in over 700 h of signals after preprocessing, belonging to 510 subjects. We then used the PPG alongside its first and second derivative as inputs into a novel spectro-temporal deep neural network with residual connections. We have shown in a leave-one-subject-out experiment that the network is able to model the dependency between PPG and BP, achieving mean absolute errors of 9.43 for systolic and 6.88 for diastolic BP. Additionally we have shown that personalization of models is important and substantially improves the results, while deriving a good general predictive model is difficult. We have made crucial parts of our study, especially the list of used subjects and our neural network code, publicly available, in an effort to provide a solid baseline and simplify potential comparison between future studies on an explicit MIMIC III subset.},

This study proposes a novel deep learning model DeepCNAP for estimating continuous BP waveform from a noninvasively measured photoplethysmography (PPG) signal in real-time. DeepCNAP was designed through the combination of deep convolutional networks and self-attention. The proposed method was constructed via 10-fold cross-validation based on the MIMIC database (the number of subjects = 942, recording time = 374.43 hours). The performance of DeepCNAP was evaluated from two perspectives: estimating ABP from PPG and classifying hemodynamically unstable events (i.e., hypertension, prehypertension, hypotension, and the normal state). The mean absolute errors of the BP estimates were 3.40 ± 4.36 mmHg for systolic BP, 1.75 ± 2.25 mmHg for diastolic BP, and 3.23 ± 2.21 mmHg for the BP waveform, indicating that DeepCNAP satisfies the standards of both the British Hypertension Society (BHS) and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). From the estimated BP, hypertension, prehypertension, hypotension, and the normal state were classified with 99.44, 97.58, 92.23, and 94.64\% accuracy, respectively. DeepCNAP enables feasible real-time estimation of invasively measured ABP from noninvasive PPG. With its noninvasive nature, high accuracy, and clinical relevance, the proposed model could be valuable in general wards at hospitals and for wearable devices in daily life.},

To increase the robustness of the DL model, this study input data of 100 Asian participants into the training database, including those with and without cardiovascular disease, each with a proportion of approximately 50\%. The experimental results revealed that the mean absolute error and standard deviation of SBP was 0.17 ± 0.46 mmHg. The mean absolute error and standard deviation of DBP was 0.27 ± 0.52 mmHg.

  abstract   = {Research on noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement using electrocardiogram (ECG)/ photoplethysmogram (PPG) and their combinations have been most popular in ambulatory health monitoring. The real challenge is motion artifact (MA) corruption in the PPG, which makes the BP measurement unreliable. This paper presents BePCon, a deep learning-based model for beat-to-beat (BtB) BP measurement using a temporal convolutional network (TCN). Initially, the signal quality assessment (SQA) of PPG is done by a self-organizing map (SOM). Next, the time-domain, statistical, wavelet and stacked autoencoder features from current and previous good quality PPG cycles are extracted. A recursive feature elimination (RFE) selects optimum set of 20 features from each cycle before being fed to the TCN to predict the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of current beat. While evaluated over 150 data records from PhysioNet MIMIC-II/III waveform database, BePCon achieves standard deviation (SD), and mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.24 mmHg and 2.38 mmHg respectively for SBP, and 1.73 mmHg, and 1.23 mmHg respectively for the DBP respectively. An improvement of accuracy by a factor of 19.56\% for SBP and 24.61\% for DBP is obtained over without SQA. BePCon also complies with AAMI and BHS Grade A standard and improvement over published works on BtB BP measurement using MIMIC-II/III waveform database. A standalone implementation with a single core 1-GHz ARM v6 controller supported by 512 MB RAM shows low latency ( 2.5 s per beat) and low memory requirement ( 32.22 KB per beat).

These methods are known to require a large amount of data during training, so data augmentation is often used. In this paper we propose a methodology for data augmentation to be used as a pre-training step. We tested our proposed method using transfer-learning in three public databases, and we demonstrate that it helps the neural network to learn the main features of the videos. We improved the Mean Absolute Error by a factor of 3 using the small dataset UBFC-rPPG, by a factor of 2.5 in the medium-size dataset COHFACE and by a factor of 1.3 in the large dataset VIPL-HR.},

We propose a hybrid neural network architecture consisting of convolutional, recurrent, and fully connected layers that operates directly on the raw PPG time series and provides BP estimation every 5 seconds. To address the problem of limited personal PPG and BP data for individuals, we propose a transfer learning technique that personalizes specific layers of a network pre-trained with abundant data from other patients. We use the MIMIC III database which contains PPG and continuous BP data measured invasively via an arterial catheter to develop and analyze our approach. Our transfer learning technique, namely BP-CRNN-Transfer, achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.52 and 2.20 mmHg for SBP and DBP estimation, respectively, outperforming existing methods. Our approach satisfies both the BHS and AAMI blood pressure measurement standards for SBP and DBP. Moreover, our results demonstrate that as little as 50 data samples per person are required to train accurate personalized models. We carry out Bland-Altman and correlation analysis to compare our method to the invasive arterial catheter, which is the gold-standard BP measurement method.},

Most non-invasive blood pressure monitors use the oscil­ lometric technique, which can be cumbersome and impractical. To address this problem, we explore several features extracted from the Photoplethysmogram (PPG) waveform and its first and second derivatives and employ deep learning recurrent models for non-invasive cuffless estimation for systolic and diastolic BP. In this research, three techniques have been considered including statistical and machine learning techniques for reducing the collinearity and redundancy in the input feature vector. The estimation models consist of a one bidirectional recurrent layer, followed by a series of stacked conventional recurrent layers and an attention layer. All models were evaluated on 942 subjects collected from the MIMIC II dataset. The best performing model (consists of one bidirectional layer followed by several Long Short-Term Memory layers and an attention layer) achieved a mean absolute error, and standard deviation of 4.51 ± 7.81 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP), and 2.6 ± 4.41 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). The results show that the deep learning model trained on features extracted from one PPG sensor yield good performance for continuous and cuffless BP monitoring. Additionally, the results fulfil the international standard for cuffless BP estimation.},

  abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) is known as an indicator of human health status, and regular measurement is helpful for early detection of cardiovascular diseases. Traditional techniques for measuring BP are either invasive or cuff-based and thus are not suitable for continuous measurement. Aiming at the deficiencies in existing studies, a novel cuffless BP estimation framework of Receptive Field Parallel Attention Shrinkage Network (RFPASN) and BP range constraint is proposed. Firstly, RFPASN uses the multi-scale large receptive field convolution module to capture the long-term dynamics in the photoplethysmography (PPG) signal without using long short-term memory (LSTM). On this basis, the features acquired by the parallel mixed domain attention module are used as thresholds, and the soft threshold function is used to screen the input features to enhance the discriminability and robustness of features, which can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Finally, in order to prevent large fluctuations in the prediction results of RFPASN, RFPASN based on BP range constraint is proposed to make the prediction results of RFPASN more accurate and reasonable. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on a publically available MIMIC-II database. The database contains normal, hypertensive and hypotensive people. We have achieved MAE of 1.63/1.59 (DBP) and 2.26/2.15 (SBP) mmHg for BP on total population of 1562 subjects. A comparative study shows that the proposed algorithm is more promising than the state-of-the-art.},

We used the large VitalDB dataset to accurately evaluate the generalization capability of the proposed model. The model achieved mean errors of -0.24 ± 11.56 mmHg for SBP and -0.5 ± 6.52 mmHg for DBP. We observed a considerable reduction in error standard deviation of above 40\% compared to the control case, which assumes no BP variation.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of features extracted from photoplethysmography (PPG) based Pulse Rate Variability (PRV) to classify hypertensive, normotensive and hypotensive events, and to estimate mean arterial, systolic and diastolic blood pressure in critically ill patients.
              METHODS: Time-domain, frequency-domain and non-linear indices from PRV were extracted from 5-min and 1-min segments obtained from PPG signals. These features were filtered using machine learning algorithms in order to obtain the optimal combination for the classification of hypertensive, hypotensive and normotensive events, and for the estimation of blood pressure.
              RESULTS: 5-min segments allowed for an improved performance in both classification and estimation tasks. Classification of blood pressure states showed around 70\% accuracy and around 75\% specificity. The sensitivity, precision and F1 scores were around 50\%. In estimating mean arterial, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure, mean absolute errors as low as 2.55 ± 0.78 mmHg, 4.74 ± 2.33 mmHg, and 1.78 ± 0.14 mmHg were obtained, respectively. Bland-Altman analysis and Wilcoxon rank sum tests showed good agreement between real and estimated values, especially for mean and diastolic arterial blood pressures.
              CONCLUSION: PRV-based features could be used for the classification of blood pressure states and the estimation of blood pressure values, although including additional features from the PPG waveform could improve the results.
              SIGNIFICANCE: PRV contains information related to blood pressure, which may aid in the continuous, noninvasive, non-intrusive estimation of blood pressure and detection of hypertensive and hypotensive events in critically ill subjects.},

However, most models based on photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals can only estimate SBP and DBP and are susceptible to noise signals. We focus on estimating the BP waveform rather than discrete BP values. We propose a model based on a generalized regression neural network to estimate the BP waveform, SBP and DBP. This model takes the raw PPG signal as input and BP waveform as output. The SBP and DBP are extracted from the estimated BP waveform. In addition, the model contains encoders and decoders, and their role is to be responsible for the conversion between the time domain and frequency domain of the waveform. The prediction results of our model show that the mean absolute error is 3.96 ± 5.36 mmHg for SBP and 2.39 ± 3.28 mmHg for DBP, the root mean square error is 5.54 for SBP and 3.45 for DBP. These results fulfill the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard and obtain grade A according to the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standard. The results show that the proposed model can effectively estimate the BP waveform only using the raw PPG signal.},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Outside of a clinical setting, oscillometric devices make remote monitoring of blood pressure and virtual care more convenient and feasible. HeartBeat Technologies Ltd developed a novel approach to measuring blood pressure remotely after an initial blood pressure reading by a nurse using the conventional measurement method. Using a finger pulse oximeter, a photoplethysmogram wave is transmitted by Bluetooth to a smartphone or tablet. A smartphone app (MediBeat) transmits the photoplethysmogram to a server for analysis by a proprietary algorithm-the person's current blood pressure is sent back to the smartphone and to the individual's health care provider.
                OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine whether the HeartBeat algorithm calculates blood pressure as accurately as required by the European Society of Hypertension International Protocol revision 2010 (ESH-IP2) for validation of blood pressure measuring devices.
                METHODS: ESH-IP2 requirements, modified to conform to a more recent international consensus statement, were followed. The ESH-IP2 establishes strict guidelines for the conduct and reporting of any validation of any device to measure blood pressure, including using the standard manual blood pressure instrument as a comparator and specific required accuracy levels for low, medium, and high ranges of blood pressure readings. The consensus statement requires a greater number of study participants for each of the blood pressure ranges. The validation of the accuracy of the algorithm was conducted with a Contec CMS50EW pulse oximeter and a Samsung Galaxy XCover 4 smartphone.
                RESULTS: The differences between the HeartBeat-calculated and the manually measured blood pressures of 62 study participants did not meet the ESH-IP2 standards for accuracy for either systolic or diastolic blood pressure measurements. There was no discernible pattern in the inaccuracies of the HeartBeat-calculated measurements.
                CONCLUSIONS: The October 4, 2019 version of the HeartBeat algorithm, implemented in combination with the MediBeat app, a pulse oximeter, and an Android smartphone, was not sufficiently accurate for use in a general adult population.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This work aims to develop an efficient and robust age-dependent multiple linear regression (MLR) model to estimate blood pressure (BP) from a single-source photoplethysmography (PPG) and biometrics, which could be embedded in the microcontroller of pulse oximeters.
              APPROACH: Hemodynamic features were extracted from the PPG signal using its waveform, derivatives, and biometrics. Whole-based, feature-based, and fusion models were evaluated and compared for different age groups. Their performance was tested using 1086 subjects with a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The improvement by adding biometrics and the long-term calibration effect were investigated in detail. The relative importance of each feature was compared between different age groups and the implication was discussed.
              MAIN RESULTS: The fusion model achieved the best performance in subjects with well-defined PPG features, whereas the feature-based method was better suited for subjects with damped signals. Adding age significantly improved both systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimation accuracy for older subjects ({\textgreater} 50 years old) with well-defined features, while it only improved diastolic BP accuracy for older subjects with damped signals. For younger subjects (≤ 50 years old), the contribution of age was very small. A simple subtraction of subject-specific calibration factors significantly reduced biometric-related errors, which also improved the linearity of BP estimation. The relative importance analysis of input features suggests that separate models are indeed necessary for different age groups with different signal qualities, especially for DBP estimation in older subjects.
              SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows a reasonable BP estimation accuracy with age-dependent MLR models, which may help to equip current pulse oximeters with additional functionalities.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of hypertension has made blood pressure (BP) measurement one of the most wanted functions in wearable devices for convenient and frequent self-assessment of health conditions. The widely adopted principle for cuffless BP monitoring is based on arterial pulse transit time (PTT), which is measured with electrocardiography and photoplethysmography (PPG). To achieve cuffless BP monitoring with more compact wearable electronics, we have previously conceived a multi-wavelength PPG (MWPPG) strategy to perform BP estimation from arteriolar PTT, requiring only a single sensing node. However, challenges remain in decoding the compounded MWPPG signals consisting of both heterogeneous physiological information and motion artifact (MA). In this work, we proposed an improved MWPPG algorithm based on principal component analysis (PCA) which matches the statistical decomposition results with the arterial pulse and capillary pulse. The arteriolar PTT is calculated accordingly as the phase shift based on the entire waveforms, instead of local peak lag time, to enhance the feature robustness. Meanwhile, the PCA-derived MA component is employed to identify and exclude the MA-contaminated segments. To evaluate the new algorithm, we performed a comparative experiment (N = 22) with a cuffless MWPPG measurement device and used double-tube auscultatory BP measurement as a reference. The results demonstrate the accuracy improvement enabled by the PCA-based operations on MWPPG signals, yielding errors of 1.44 ± 6.89 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and -1.00 ± 6.71 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure. In conclusion, the proposed PCA-based method can improve the performance of MWPPG in wearable medical devices for cuffless BP measurement.},

  abstract = {Blood pressure measurements are one of the most routinely performed medical tests globally. Blood pressure is an important metric since it provides information that can be used to diagnose several vascular diseases. Conventional blood pressure measurement systems use cuff-based devices to measure the blood pressure, which may be uncomfortable and sometimes burdensome to the subjects. Therefore, in this study, we propose a cuffless blood pressure estimation model based on Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). We propose a heterogeneous finger model for the MCS at wavelengths of 905 nm and 940 nm. After recording the photon intensities from the MCS over a certain range of blood pressure values, the actual photoplethysmography (PPG) signals were used to estimate blood pressure. We used both publicly available and self-made datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. In case of the publicly available dataset for transmission-type MCS, the mean absolute errors are 3.32 ± 6.03 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP), 2.02 ± 2.64 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and 1.76 ± 2.8 mmHg for mean arterial pressure (MAP). The self-made dataset is used for both transmission- and reflection-type MCSs; its mean absolute errors are 2.54 ± 4.24 mmHg for SBP, 1.49 ± 2.82 mmHg for DBP, and 1.51 ± 2.41 mmHg for MAP in the transmission-type case as well as 3.35 ± 5.06 mmHg for SBP, 2.07 ± 2.83 mmHg for DBP, and 2.12 ± 2.83 mmHg for MAP in the reflection-type case. The estimated results of the SBP and DBP satisfy the requirements of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standards and are within Grade A according to the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards. These results show that the proposed model is efficient for estimating blood pressures using fingertip PPG signals.},

  abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) is among the most important vital signals. Estimation of absolute BP solely using photoplethysmography (PPG) has gained immense attention over the last years. Available works differ in terms of used features as well as classifiers and bear large differences in their results. This work aims to provide a machine learning method for absolute BP estimation, its interpretation using computational methods and its critical appraisal in face of the current literature. We used data from three different sources including 273 subjects and 259,986 single beats. We extracted multiple features from PPG signals and its derivatives. BP was estimated by xgboost regression. For interpretation we used Shapley additive values (SHAP). Absolute systolic BP estimation using a strict separation of subjects yielded a mean absolute error of 9.456mmHg and correlation of 0.730. The results markedly improve if data separation is changed (MAE: 6.366mmHg, r: 0.874). Interpretation by means of SHAP revealed four features from PPG, its derivation and its decomposition to be most relevant. The presented approach depicts a general way to interpret multivariate prediction algorithms and reveals certain features to be valuable for absolute BP estimation. Our work underlines the considerable impact of data selection and of training/testing separation, which must be considered in detail when algorithms are to be compared. In order to make our work traceable, we have made all methods available to the public.},

This study investigates the ability of a deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) to generate continuous arterial blood pressure (ABP) by only utilizing photoplethysmography (PPG). A total of 18 patients are utilized. LeNet-5- and U-Net-based DCAEs, respectively abbreviated LDCAE and UDCAE, are compared to the MP60 IntelliVue Patient Monitor, as the gold standard. Moreover, in order to investigate the data generalization, the cross-validation (CV) method is conducted. The results show that the UDCAE provides superior results in producing the systolic blood pressure (SBP) estimation. Meanwhile, the LDCAE gives a slightly better result for the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) prediction. Finally, the genetic algorithm-based optimization deep convolutional autoencoder (GDCAE) is further administered to optimize the ensemble of the CV models. The results reveal that the GDCAE is superior to either the LDCAE or UDCAE. In conclusion, this study exhibits that systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) can also be accurately achieved by only utilizing a single PPG signal.},

The algorithm combines photoplethysmography (PPG) waveform analysis and biometrics to estimate BP, and was evaluated in subjects with various age, height, weight and BP levels (n = 1249). In the young population ({\textless}50 years old) with low, medium and high systolic blood pressures (SBP, {\textless}120 mmHg; 120-139 mmHg; ≥140 mmHg), the fitting errors are 6.3 ± 7.2, -3.9 ± 7.2 and -20.2 ± 14.2 mmHg for SBP respectively; In the older population ({\textgreater}50 years old) with the same categories, the fitting errors are 12.8 ± 9.0, 0.5 ± 8.2 and -14.6 ± 11.5 mmHg for SBP respectively. A simple personalized calibration reduces fitting errors significantly (n = 147), and good peripheral perfusion helps to improve the fitting accuracy. In conclusion, PPG may be used to calculate BP without calibration in certain populations. When calibrated, it shows great potential to serially monitor BP fluctuation, which can bring tremendous economic and health benefits.},

Using the University of California Irvine (UCI) database consisting of 348 records, the proposed method achieves a best error performance of 0.00±8.46 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP), and -0.04±5.36 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respectively, in terms of the mean error (ME) and the standard deviation (SD) of error, ranking grade B for SBP and grade A for DBP under the British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocol.

Most of photoplethysmography (PPG)-based BP estimation methods are susceptible to noise and only provides systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) prediction. Here, instead of estimating a discrete value, we focus on different perspectives to estimate the whole waveform of BP. We propose a novel deep learning model to learn how to perform signal-to-signal translation from PPG to arterial blood pressure (ABP). Furthermore, using a raw PPG signal only as the input, the output of the proposed model is a continuous ABP signal. Based on the translated ABP signal, we extract the SBP and DBP values accordingly to ease the comparative evaluation. Our prediction results achieve average absolute error under 5 mmHg, with 70\% confidence for SBP and 95\% confidence for DBP without complex feature engineering. These results fulfill the standard from Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) with grade A. From the results, we believe that our model is applicable and potentially boosts the accuracy of an effective signal-to-signal continuous blood pressure estimation.},

However, existing continuous BP monitoring approaches, especially cuff-less BP monitoring approaches, are all contraptions which complex and huge computation required. For example, for the most sophisticated cuff-less BP monitoring method using pulse transit time (PTT), the simultaneous record of photoplethysmography (PPG) signal and electrocardiography (ECG) are required, and various measurement of characteristic points are needed. These issues hindered widely application of cuff less BP measurement in the wearable devices. In this study, a novel BP estimation method using single PPG signal feature was proposed and its performance in BP estimation was also tested. The results showed that the new approach proposed in this study has a mean error -0.91 ± 3.84 mmHg for SBP estimation and -0.36 ± 3.36 mmHg for DBP estimation respectively. This approach performed better than the traditional PTT based BP estimation, which mean error for SBP estimation was -0.31 ± 4.78 mmHg, and for DBP estimation was -0.18 ± 4.32 mmHg. Further investigation revealed that this new BP estimation approach only required measurement of one characteristic point, reducing much computation when implementing. These results demonstrated that this new approach might be more suitable implemented in the wearable BP monitoring devices.},

To investigate the proposed method, two statistical analyses were conducted for comparison between BP measured by the micromanometer-based gold standard method (BPMEAS) and the Ear PPG-based proposed method (BPEST) for swine cardiac model. First, Pearson's correlation analysis showed high positive correlations (r = 0.92, p {\textless} 0.01) between BPMEAS and BPEST. Second, the paired-samples t-test on the BP parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure) of the two methods indicated no significant differences (p {\textgreater} 0.05).

As photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals can be recorded non-invasively, research has been highly conducted to measure BP using PPG recently. In this paper, we propose a U-net deep learning architecture that uses fingertip PPG signal as input to estimate arterial BP (ABP) waveform non-invasively. From this waveform, we have also measured systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP). The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 100 subjects from two publicly available databases: MIMIC and MIMIC-III. The predicted ABP waveforms correlated highly with the reference waveforms and we have obtained an average Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.993. The mean absolute error is 3.68 ± 4.42 mmHg for SBP, 1.97 ± 2.92 mmHg for DBP, and 2.17 ± 3.06 mmHg for MAP which satisfy the requirements of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard and obtain grade A according to the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standard.

  abstract   = {Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring plays a critical role in the early prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. However, cuff-based inflatable devices cannot be used for continuous BP monitoring, while pulse transit time or multi-parameter-based methods require more bioelectrodes to acquire electrocardiogram signals. Thus, estimating the BP waveforms only based on photoplethysmography (PPG) signals for continuous BP monitoring has essential clinical values. Nevertheless, extracting useful features from raw PPG signals for fine-grained BP waveform estimation is challenging due to the physiological variation and noise interference. For single PPG analysis utilizing deep learning methods, the previous works depend mainly on stacked convolution operation, which ignores the underlying complementary time-dependent information. Thus, this work presents a novel Transformer-based method with knowledge distillation (KD-Informer) for BP waveform estimation. Meanwhile, we integrate the prior information of PPG patterns, selected by a novel backward elimination algorithm, into the knowledge transfer branch of the KD-Informer. With these strategies, the model can effectively capture the discriminative features through a lightweight architecture during the learning process. Then, we further adopt an effective transfer learning technique to demonstrate the excellent generalization capability of the proposed model using two independent multicenter datasets. Specifically, we first fine-tuned the KD-Informer with a large and high-quality dataset (Mindray dataset) and then transferred the pre-trained model to the target domain (MIMIC dataset). The experimental test results on the MIMIC dataset showed that the KD-Informer exhibited an estimation error of 0.02 ± 5.93 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP) and 0.01 ± 3.87 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP), which complied with the association for the advancement of medical instrumentation (AAMI) standard. These results demonstrate that the KD-Informer has high reliability and elegant robustness to measure continuous BP waveforms.},

Various studies have proposed cuff-less BP monitoring methods using pulse transit time. We propose an end-to-end deep learning architecture using only raw signals without the process of extracting features to improve the BP estimation performance using the attention mechanism. The proposed model consisted of a convolutional neural network, a bidirectional gated recurrent unit, and an attention mechanism. The model was trained by a calibration-based method, using the data of each subject. The performance of the model was compared to the model that used each combination of the three signals, and the model with the attention mechanism showed better performance than other state-of-the-art methods, including conventional linear regression method using pulse transit time (PTT). A total of 15 subjects were recruited, and electrocardiogram, ballistocardiogram, and photoplethysmogram levels were measured. The 95\% confidence interval of the reference BP was [86.34, 143.74] and [51.28, 88.74] for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), respectively. The      R  2     values were 0.52 and 0.49, and the mean-absolute-error values were 4.06 ± 4.04 and 3.33 ± 3.42 for SBP and DBP, respectively.

Traditional blood pressure measurement techniques are either invasive or cuff-based, which are impractical, intermittent, and uncomfortable for patients. Over the past few decades, several indirect approaches using photoplethysmogram (PPG) have been investigated, namely, pulse transit time, pulse wave velocity, pulse arrival time and pulse wave analysis, in an effort to utilise PPG for estimating blood pressure. Recent advancements in signal processing techniques, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, have also opened up exciting new horizons for PPG-based cuff less and continuous monitoring of blood pressure. Such a device will have a significant and transformative impact in monitoring patients’ vital signs, especially those at risk of cardiovascular disease. This paper provides a comprehensive review for non-invasive cuff-less blood pressure estimation using the PPG approach along with their challenges and limitations.},

  abstract   = {Introduction. Blood pressure (BP) has been a potential risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. BP measurement is one of the most useful parameters for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. At present, BP measurement mainly relies on cuff-based techniques that cause inconvenience and discomfort to users. Although some of the present prototype cuffless BP measurement techniques are able to reach overall acceptable accuracies, they require an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a photoplethysmograph (PPG) that make them unsuitable for true wearable applications. Therefore, developing a single PPG-based cuffless BP estimation algorithm with enough accuracy would be clinically and practically useful. Methods. The University of Queensland vital sign dataset (online database) was accessed to extract raw PPG signals and its corresponding reference BPs (systolic BP and diastolic BP). The online database consisted of PPG waveforms of 32 cases from whom 8133 (good quality) signal segments (5 s for each) were extracted, preprocessed, and normalised in both width and amplitude. Three most significant pulse features (pulse area, pulse rising time, and width 25\%) with their corresponding reference BPs were used to train and test three machine learning algorithms (regression tree, multiple linear regression (MLR), and support vector machine (SVM)). A 10-fold cross-validation was applied to obtain overall BP estimation accuracy, separately for the three machine learning algorithms. Their estimation accuracies were further analysed separately for three clinical BP categories (normotensive, hypertensive, and hypotensive). Finally, they were compared with the ISO standard for noninvasive BP device validation (average difference no greater than 5 mmHg and SD no greater than 8 mmHg). Results. In terms of overall estimation accuracy, the regression tree achieved the best overall accuracy for SBP (mean and SD of difference: −0.1 ± 6.5 mmHg) and DBP (mean and SD of difference: −0.6 ± 5.2 mmHg). MLR and SVM achieved the overall mean difference less than 5 mmHg for both SBP and DBP, but their SD of difference was {\textgreater}8 mmHg. Regarding the estimation accuracy in each BP categories, only the regression tree achieved acceptable ISO standard for SBP (−1.1 ± 5.7 mmHg) and DBP (−0.03 ± 5.6 mmHg) in the normotensive category. MLR and SVM did not achieve acceptable accuracies in any BP categories. Conclusion. This study developed and compared three machine learning algorithms to estimate BPs using PPG only and revealed that the regression tree algorithm was the best approach with overall acceptable accuracy to ISO standard for BP device validation. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the regression tree algorithm achieved acceptable measurement accuracy only in the normotensive category, suggesting that future algorithm development for BP estimation should be more specific for different BP categories.},

Consequently, there is a global demand for continuous and non-invasive blood pressure (BP) measurements that are convenient, easy to use, and more accurate than the currently available methods for detecting hypertension. This could easily be achieved through the integration of single-site photoplethysmography (PPG) readings into wearable devices, although improved reliability and an understanding of BP estimation accuracy are essential. This review paper focuses on understanding the features of PPG associated with BP and examines the development of this technology over the 2010–2019 period in terms of validation, sample size, diversity of subjects, and datasets used. Challenges and opportunities to move single-site PPG forward are also discussed.},

Analysis of systolic and pulse pressure variations during positive pressure ventilation, ΔUp, ΔDown, and changes in the preejection period on both arterial and photoplethysmographic waveforms were possible in 49 (86\%) patients. The pulse pressure variation and preejection period were similar when calculated using both arterial blood pressure and photoplethysmography, whereas the other variables were different. Photoplethysmographic pulse variation {\textgreater}9\% identified patients with arterial pulse pressure variation {\textgreater}13\% (area under ROC curve = 0.85) or ΔDown {\textgreater}5 mm Hg (area under ROC curve = 0.85). In hypotensive patients, photoplethysmographic pulse variation {\textgreater}9\% remained the best threshold value (pulse pressure variation {\textgreater}13\%: area under ROC curve = 0.90; ΔDown {\textgreater}5 mm Hg: area under ROC curve = 0.93) for predicting fluid responsiveness. In conclusion, this study showed that pulse variations observed in the arterial pressure waveform and photoplethysmogram are similiar in response to positive pressure ventilation. Furthermore, photoplethysmographic pulse variation {\textgreater} 9\% identifies patients with ventilation-induced arterial blood pressure variation that is likely to respond to fluid administration.},

Current methods of continuous measurement of blood pressure are either invasive and/or require expensive equipment. Therefore, we investigated a new method for the continuous estimation of two main features of blood pressure waveform: systolic and diastolic pressures. The estimates were obtained from a photoplethysmography signal as input to the fifth order autoregressive moving average models. The performance of the method was evaluated using beat-to-beat full-wave blood pressure measurements from 15 young subjects, with no known cardiovascular disorder, in supine position as they breathed normally and also while they performed a breath-hold maneuver. The level of error in the estimates, as measured by the root mean square of the model residuals, was less than 5 mmHg during normal breathing and less than 8 mmHg during the breath-hold maneuver. The mean of model residuals both during normal breathing and breath-hold maneuvers was considered to be less than 3.2 mmHg. The dependency of the accuracy of the estimates on the subject data was assessed by comparing the modeling errors for the 15 subjects. Less than 1\% of the models showed significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) from the other models, which indicates a high level of consistency among the models.},

  abstract  = {Exploiting photoplethysmography signals (PPG) for non-invasive blood pressure (BP) measurement is interesting for various reasons. First, PPG can easily be measured using fingerclip sensors. Second, camera-based approaches allow to derive remote PPG (rPPG) signals similar to PPG and therefore provide the opportunity for non-invasive measurements of BP. Various methods relying on machine learning techniques have recently been published. Performances are often reported as the mean average error (MAE) on the data which is problematic. This work aims to analyze the PPG- and rPPG-based BP prediction error with respect to the underlying data distribution. First, we train established neural network (NN) architectures and derive an appropriate parameterization of input segments drawn from continuous PPG signals. Second, we apply this parameterization to a larger PPG dataset and train NNs to predict BP. The resulting prediction errors increase towards less frequent BP values. Third, we use transfer learning to train the NNs for rPPG based BP prediction. The resulting performances are similar to the PPG-only case. Finally, we apply a personalization technique and retrain our NNs with subject-specific data. This slightly reduces the prediction errors.},

  abstract  = {According to the WTO, there were 1.13 billion hypertension patients worldwide in 2015. The WTO encouraged people to check the blood pressure regularly because a large amount of patients do not have any symptoms. However, traditional cuff measurement results are not enough to represent the patient′s blood pressure status over a period of time. Therefore, there is an urgent need for portable, easy to operate, continuous measurement, and low-cost blood pressure measuring devices. In this paper, we adopted the convolutional neural network (CNN), based on the Hilbert–Huang Transform (HHT) method, to predict blood pressure (BP) risk level using photoplethysmography (PPG). Considering that the PPG′s first and second derivative signals are related to atherosclerosis and vascular elasticity, we created a dataset called PPG+; the images of PPG+ carry information on PPG and its derivatives. We built three classification experiments by collecting 582 data records (the length of each record is 10 s) from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database: NT (normotension) vs. HT (hypertension), NT vs. PHT (prehypertension), and (NT + PHT) vs. HT; the F1 scores of the PPG + experiments using AlexNet were 98.90\%, 85.80\%, and 93.54\%, respectively. We found that, first, the dataset established by the HHT method performed well in the BP grade prediction experiment. Second, because the Hilbert spectra of the PPG are simple and periodic, AlexNet, which has only 8 layers, got better results. More layers instead increased the cost and difficulty of training.},

Early detection of abnormal blood pressure can help patients to get early treatment and reduce mortality associated with cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it is very valuable to have a mechanism to perform real-time monitoring for blood pressure changes in patients. In this paper, we propose deep learning regression models using an electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) for the real-time estimation of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values. We use a bidirectional layer of long short-term memory (LSTM) as the first layer and add a residual connection inside each of the following layers of the LSTMs. We also perform experiments to compare the performance between the traditional machine learning methods, another existing deep learning model, and the proposed deep learning models using the dataset of Physionet's multiparameter intelligent monitoring in intensive care II (MIMIC II) as the source of ECG and PPG signals as well as the arterial blood pressure (ABP) signal. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the existing methods and is able to achieve accurate estimation which is promising in order to be applied in clinical practice effectively.},

This puts a massive strain not only on the lives of those affected, but also on the public healthcare systems. To understand the dynamics of the healthy and unhealthy heart, doctors commonly use an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood pressure (BP) readings. These methods are often quite invasive, particularly when continuous arterial blood pressure (ABP) readings are taken, and not to mention very costly. Using machine learning methods, we develop a framework capable of inferring ABP from a single optical photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor alone. We train our framework across distributed models and data sources to mimic a large-scale distributed collaborative learning experiment that could be implemented across low-cost wearables. Our time-series-to-time-series generative adversarial network (T2TGAN) is capable of high-quality continuous ABP generation from a PPG signal with a mean error of 2.95 mmHg and a standard deviation of 19.33 mmHg when estimating mean arterial pressure on a previously unseen, noisy, independent dataset. To our knowledge, this framework is the first example of a GAN capable of continuous ABP generation from an input PPG signal that also uses a federated learning methodology.},

  abstract = {Arterial blood pressure (ABP) is an important vital sign from which it can be extracted valuable information about the subject's health. After studying its morphology it is possible to diagnose cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, so ABP routine control is recommended. The most common method of controlling ABP is the cuff-based method, from which it is obtained only the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively). This paper proposes a cuff-free method to estimate the morphology of the average ABP pulse (ABPM¯) through a deep learning model based on a seq2seq architecture with attention mechanism. It only needs raw photoplethysmogram signals (PPG) from the finger and includes the capacity to integrate both categorical and continuous demographic information (DI). The experiments were performed on more than 1100 subjects from the MIMIC database for which their corresponding age and gender were consulted. Without allowing the use of data from the same subjects to train and test, the mean absolute errors (MAE) were 6.57 ± 0.20 and 14.39 ± 0.42 mmHg for DBP and SBP, respectively. For ABPM¯, R correlation coefficient and the MAE were 0.98 ± 0.001 and 8.89 ± 0.10 mmHg. In summary, this methodology is capable of transforming PPG into an ABP pulse, which obtains better results when DI of the subjects is used, potentially useful in times when wireless devices are becoming more popular.},

  abstract  = {Several studies have been proposed to estimate blood pressure (BP) with cuffless devices using only a Photoplethysmograph (PPG) sensor on the basis of the physiological knowledge that the PPG changes depend on the state of the cardiovascular system. In these studies, machine learning algorithms were used to extract various features from the wave height and the elapsed time from the rising point of the pulse wave to feature points have been used to estimate the BP. However, the accuracy is still not adequate to be used as medical equipment because their features cannot express fully information of the pulse waveform which changes according to the BP. And, no other effective knowledge about the pulse waveform for estimating BP has been found yet. Therefore, in this study, we focus on the autoencoder which can extract complex features and can add new features of the pulse waveform for estimating the BP. By using autoencoder, we extracted 100 features from the coupling signal of the pulse wave and from its first-order differentiation and second-order differentiation. The result of examination with 1363 test subjects show that the correlation coefficients and the standard deviation of the difference between the measured BP and the estimated BP got improved from R = 0.67, SD = 13.97 without autoencoder to R = 0.78, SD = 11.86 with autoencoder.},

  abstract = {Objective
              This work presents a system for a simultaneous non-invasive estimate of the blood glucose level (BGL) and the systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, using a photoplethysmograph (PPG) and machine learning techniques. The method is independent of the person whose values are being measured and does not need calibration over time or subjects.
              Methodology
              The architecture of the system consists of a photoplethysmograph sensor, an activity detection module, a signal processing module that extracts features from the PPG waveform, and a machine learning algorithm that estimates the SBP, DBP and BGL values. The idea that underlies the system is that there is functional relationship between the shape of the PPG waveform and the blood pressure and glucose levels.
              Results
              As described in this paper we tested this method on 410 individuals without performing any personalized calibration. The results were computed after cross validation. The machine learning techniques tested were: ridge linear regression, a multilayer perceptron neural network, support vector machines and random forests. The best results were obtained with the random forest technique. In the case of blood pressure, the resulting coefficients of determination for reference vs. prediction were RSBP2=0.91, RDBP2=0.89, and RBGL2=0.90. For the glucose estimation, distribution of the points on a Clarke error grid placed 87.7\% of points in zone A, 10.3\% in zone B, and 1.9\% in zone D. Blood pressure values complied with the grade B protocol of the British Hypertension society.
              Conclusion
              An effective system for estimate of blood glucose and blood pressure from a photoplethysmograph is presented. The main advantage of the system is that for clinical use it complies with the grade B protocol of the British Hypertension society for the blood pressure and only in 1.9\% of the cases did not detect hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a non-contact blood pressure implement (NCBP) system based on imaging photo­ plethysmography (IPPG) The system collects facial videos through a webcam under ambient light, and extracts pulse wave signals from the videos by means of IPPG technology. From the signals (also called IPPG signals), we extracted 26 features for estimating blood pressure (BP), and trained them through four machine learning al­ gorithms. Finally, we selected the most accurate model for blood pressure prediction. By experimenting on 191 volunteers and comparing four models, support vector regression (SVR) is the best model for predicting blood pressure. The results of SVR are that the standard deviation (STD) and mean absolute error (MAE) of systolic blood pressure (SBP) are 3.35 mmHg, 9.97 mmHg, and those of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are 2.58 mmHg, 7.59 mmHg respectively. We conclude that through our proposed system based on IPPG technology, blood pressure can be accurately predicted in a non-contact way. In addition, this paper proposes two new methods, the region of interest (ROI) selection method based on colormaps and robust peak extraction method, which solve the key steps in IPPG technology. Finally, we discussed the influence of light intensity on the experiment, and simplified the NCBP experimental device. The system has the potential of replacing the traditional cuff-based sphygmomanometers, and has guiding significance to the future development of blood pressure measurement devices.},

Blood pressure is an important parameter and indicator in cardiovascular disease, patients with CVD who have multiple risk factors such as hypertension, stress, and obesity have been increasing. Therefore, it is important in the field of cardiovascular disease prevention to predict those at risk of cardiovascular diseases in the general population. Electrocardiogram is not suitable for wearable devices and PPG is a non-invasive, inexpensive, and convenient diagnostic tool for monitoring of heart and blood pressure. Here, we present a PPG (photoplethysmography) based non-invasive detection of heart rate and blood pressure, containing 1260 segments from 140 subjects an age range of 20 - 50 years. Data acquisition was carried out using the standard operating procedures. The present study investigates the photoplethysmography signal filtering of various noise removal, extraction of PPG morphological features and its derivatives which contain a blood circulatory system information, and finally derived forty five diagnostic engineered features. A novel signal processing technique was applied to extract salient pulse wave for heart rate and blood pressure detection. The subset of optimal features was extracted using feature extraction methods in relation to the physiology of heart rate and blood pressure processes.

  abstract  = {Hypertension is a potentially unsafe health ailment, which can be indicated directly from the blood pressure (BP). Hypertension always leads to other health complications. Continuous monitoring of BP is very important; however, cuff-based BP measurements are discrete and uncomfortable to the user. To address this need, a cuff-less, continuous, and noninvasive BP measurement system is proposed using the photoplethysmograph (PPG) signal and demographic features using machine learning (ML) algorithms. PPG signals were acquired from 219 subjects, which undergo preprocessing and feature extraction steps. Time, frequency, and time-frequency domain features were extracted from the PPG and their derivative signals. Feature selection techniques were used to reduce the computational complexity and to decrease the chance of over-fitting the ML algorithms. The features were then used to train and evaluate ML algorithms. The best regression models were selected for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimation individually. Gaussian process regression (GPR) along with the ReliefF feature selection algorithm outperforms other algorithms in estimating SBP and DBP with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.74 and 3.59, respectively. This ML model can be implemented in hardware systems to continuously monitor BP and avoid any critical health conditions due to sudden changes.},

  abstract  = {Blood Pressure (BP) is one of the most important physiological indicators that provides useful information in the field of health-care monitoring. Blood pressure may be measured by both invasive and non-invasive methods. A novel algorithmic approach is presented to estimate systolic and diastolic blood pressure accurately in a way that does not require any explicit user calibration, i.e., it is non-invasive and cuff-less. The approach herein described can be applied in a medical device, as well as in commercial mobile smartphones by an ad hoc developed software based on the proposed algorithm. The authors propose a system suitable for blood pressure estimation based on the PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) physiological signal sampling time-series. Photoplethysmography is a simple optical technique that can be used to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. It is non-invasive since it takes measurements at the skin surface. In this paper, the authors present an easy and smart method to measure BP through careful neural and mathematical analysis of the PPG signals. The PPG data are processed with an ad hoc bio-inspired mathematical model that estimates systolic and diastolic pressure values through an innovative analysis of the collected physiological data. We compared our results with those measured using a classical cuff-based blood pressure measuring device with encouraging results of about 97\% accuracy.},

  abstract   = {Objective: The paper focuses on development of robust and accurate processing solutions for continuous and cuﬀ-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring. In this regard, a robust deep learning-based framework is proposed for computation of low latency, continuous, and calibration-free upper and lower bounds on the systolic and diastolic BP. Method : Referred to as the BP-Net, the proposed framework is a novel convolutional architecture that provides longer eﬀective memory while achieving superior performance due to incorporation of casual dialated convolutions and residual connections. To utilize the real potential of deep learning in extraction of intrinsic features (deep features) and enhance the long-term robustness, the BP-Net uses raw Electrocardiograph (ECG) and Photoplethysmograph (PPG) signals without extraction of any form of hand-crafted features as it is common in existing solutions. Results: By capitalizing on the fact that datasets used in recent literature are not uniﬁed and properly deﬁned, a benchmark dataset is constructed from the MIMIC-I and MIMIC-III databases obtained from PhysioNet. The proposed BP-Net is evaluated based on this benchmark dataset demonstrating promising performance and shows superior generalizable capacity. Conclusion: The proposed BP-Net architecture is more accurate than canonical recurrent networks and enhances the long-term robustness of the BP estimation task. Signiﬁcance: The proposed BP-Net architecture addresses key drawbacks of existing BP estimation solutions, i.e., relying heavily on extraction of hand-crafted features, such as pulse arrival time (PAT), and; Lack of robustness. Finally, the constructed BP-Net dataset provides a uniﬁed base for evaluation and comparison of deep learning-based BP estimation algorithms.},

  abstract = {Conventional blood pressure (BP) measurement methods have different drawbacks such as being invasive, cuff-based or requiring manual operations. There is significant interest in the development of non-invasive, cuff-less and continual BP measurement based on physiological measurement. However, in these methods, extracting features from signals is challenging in the presence of noise or signal distortion. When using machine learning, errors in feature extraction result in errors in BP estimation, therefore, this study explores the use of raw signals as a direct input to a deep learning model. To enable comparison with the traditional machine learning models which use features from the photoplethysmogram and electrocardiogram, a hybrid deep learning model that utilises both raw signals and physical characteristics (age, height, weight and gender) is developed. This hybrid model performs best in terms of both diastolic BP (DBP) and systolic BP (SBP) with the mean absolute error being 3.23 ± 4.75 mmHg and 4.43 ± 6.09 mmHg respectively. DBP and SBP meet the Grade A and Grade B performance requirements of the British Hypertension Society respectively.},

  abstract  = {Blood pressure (BP) is a vital sign of the human body and an important parameter for early detection of cardiovascular diseases. It is usually measured using cuff-based devices or monitored invasively in critically-ill patients. This paper presents two techniques that enable continuous and noninvasive cuff-less BP estimation using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The first technique is calibration-free. The second technique achieves a more accurate measurement by estimating BP changes with respect to a patient's PPG and ground truth BP values at calibration time. For this purpose, it uses Siamese network architecture. When trained and tested on the MIMIC-II database, it achieves mean absolute difference in the systolic and diastolic BP of 5.95 mmHg and 3.41 mmHg respectively. These results almost comply with the AAMI recommendation and are as accurate as the values estimated by many home BP measuring devices.},

  abstract   = {High blood pressure (BP) is a major source of death worldwide as it slows down the flow of blood and oxygen, and leads to various chronic diseases such as chest pain (angina), heart disease and heart failure. Therefore, regular measurement and monitoring of BP is an essential element of the home healthy settings, especially for the elderly. In this study, a novel deep neural network (called MLP-BP, which including gMLP-BP and MLPlstm-BP) adapted from MLP-Mixer is proposed to estimate BP from plethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiograph (ECG) signal. More precisely, a novel multi-filter to multi-channel (MFMC) is presented for preprocessing ECG and PPG signals, namely using various filters and filtering parameters to handle with ECG and PPG, and integrating the filtered bio-signals into multi-channel data. Then, the multi-channel data is fed into the proposed methods to estimate blood pressure directly. The up-to-date concept MLP-Mixer is employed in the proposed frameworks, which are both end-to-end pipelines without any handcrafted feature extraction operation. MLPlstm-BP (gMLP-BP) achieves the predicted diastolic BP with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.13 (2.47) mmHg, and with a standard deviation (SD) of 3.07 (3.52) mmHg; those of systolic BP is an MAE of 3.52 (4.18) mmHg, and a SD of 5.10 (5.87) mmHg on the MIMIC II dataset. In addition, the testing results are all meet the highest level of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and British Hypertension Society (BHS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods attain competitive results over state-of-the-art (SOTA) learning-based pipelines.},

  abstract  = {High blood pressure (BP) may lead to further health complications if not monitored and controlled, especially for critically ill patients. Particularly, there are two types of blood pressure monitoring, invasive measurement, whereby a central line is inserted into the patient’s body, which is associated with infection risks. The second measurement is cuff-based that monitors BP by detecting the blood volume change at the skin surface using a pulse oximeter or wearable devices such as a smartwatch. This paper aims to estimate the blood pressure using machine learning from photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals, which is obtained from cuff-based monitoring. To avoid the issues associated with machine learning such as improperly choosing the classifiers and/or not selecting the best features, this paper utilized the tree-based pipeline optimization tool (TPOT) to automate the machine learning pipeline to select the best regression models for estimating both systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) separately. As a pre-processing stage, notch filter, band-pass filter, and zero phase filtering were applied by TPOT to eliminate any potential noise inherent in the signal. Then, the automated feature selection was performed to select the best features to estimate the BP, including SBP and DBP features, which are extracted using random forest (RF) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN), respectively. To train and test the model, the PhysioNet global dataset was used, which contains 32.061 million samples for 1000 subjects. Finally, the proposed approach was evaluated and validated using the mean absolute error (MAE). The results obtained were 6.52 mmHg for SBS and 4.19 mmHg for DBP, which show the superiority of the proposed model over the related works.},

  abstract   = {Cuff-less Blood Pressure (BP) monitoring has gained interest of the research community in recent years, due to its importance in continuous and non-invasive monitoring of BP for early detection of hypertension, thereby reducing mortality. Several approaches that involve photoplethysmography (PPG) and Pulse Transit Time (PTT) have been explored with promising results; however the requirement of two sensors makes them obtrusive for continuous use. Single PPG sensor approaches using machine learning have also been attempted, but there are certain deficiencies in these methods as they go for a one-size-fits-all approach. In this work, we develop an ensemble of BP prediction models based on demographic and physiological partitioning. Also, we incorporate a set of unique PPG features into our models, which results in test accuracies of 5 mmHg Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for Diastolic BP, and 6.9 mmHg MAE for Systolic BP. Given our marked improvement over ubiquitous models (18\% for Diastolic BP and 11.5\% for Systolic BP), this approach opens up avenues where single PPG sensor based methods can predict BP with a high degree of accuracy. This is a big step towards developing continuous BP monitoring systems, and can help in better management of cardiac health.},

  abstract = {Extensive research has been performed on continuous and noninvasive cuff-less blood pressure (BP) measurement using artificial intelligence algorithms. This approach involves extracting certain features from physiological signals, such as ECG, PPG, ICG, and BCG, as independent variables and extracting features from arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals as dependent variables and then using machine-learning algorithms to develop a blood pressure estimation model based on these data. The greatest challenge of this field is the insufficient accuracy of estimation models. This paper proposes a novel blood pressure estimation method with a clustering step for accuracy improvement. The proposed method involves extracting pulse transit time (PTT), PPG intensity ratio (PIR), and heart rate (HR) features from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals as the inputs of clustering and regression, extracting systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) features from ABP signals as dependent variables, and finally developing regression models by applying gradient boosting regression (GBR), random forest regression (RFR), and multilayer perceptron regression (MLP) on each cluster. The method was implemented using the MIMIC-II data set with the silhouette criterion used to determine the optimal number of clusters. The results showed that because of the inconsistency, high dispersion, and multitrend behavior of the extracted features vectors, the accuracy can be significantly improved by running a clustering algorithm and then developing a regression model on each cluster and finally weighted averaging of the results based on the error of each cluster. When implemented with 5 clusters and GBR, this approach yielded an MAE of 2.56 for SBP estimates and 2.23 for DBP estimates, which were significantly better than the best results without clustering (DBP: 6.27, SBP: 6.36).},

  abstract  = {Learning decent representations from unlabeled time-series data with temporal dynamics is a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised Time-Series representation learning framework via Temporal and Contextual Contrasting (TS-TCC), to learn time-series representation from unlabeled data. First, the raw timeseries data are transformed into two different yet correlated views by using weak and strong augmentations. Second, we propose a novel temporal contrasting module to learn robust temporal representations by designing a tough cross-view prediction task. Last, to further learn discriminative representations, we propose a contextual contrasting module built upon the contexts from the temporal contrasting module. It attempts to maximize the similarity among different contexts of the same sample while minimizing similarity among contexts of different samples. Experiments have been carried out on three real-world time-series datasets. The results manifest that training a linear classiﬁer on top of the features learned by our proposed TS-TCC performs comparably with the supervised training. Additionally, our proposed TS-TCC shows high efﬁciency in few-labeled data and transfer learning scenarios. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/emadeldeen24/TS-TCC.},

  abstract = {Background: Continuous noninvasive arterial pressure monitoring devices are available for bedside use, but the accuracy and precision of these devices have not been evaluated in a systematic review and meta-analysis.
              Methods: The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing continuous noninvasive arterial pressure monitoring with invasive arterial pressure monitoring. Random-effects pooled bias and SD of bias for systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure were calculated. Continuous noninvasive arterial pressure monitoring was considered acceptable if pooled estimates of bias and SD were not greater than 5 and 8 mmHg, respectively, as recommended by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation.
              Results: Twenty-eight studies (919 patients) were included. The overall random-effect pooled bias and SD were −1.6 ± 12.2 mmHg (95\% limits of agreement −25.5 to 22.2 mmHg) for systolic arterial pressure, 5.3 ± 8.3 mmHg (−11.0 to 21.6 mmHg) for diastolic arterial pressure, and 3.2 ± 8.4 mmHg (−13.4 to 19.7 mmHg) for mean arterial pressure. In 14 studies focusing on currently commercially available devices, bias and SD were −1.8 ± 12.4 mmHg (−26.2 to 22.5 mmHg) for systolic arterial pressure, 6.0 ± 8.6 mmHg (−10.9 to 22.9 mmHg) for diastolic arterial pressure, and 3.9 ± 8.7 mmHg (−13.1 to 21.0 mmHg) for mean arterial pressure.
              Conclusions: The results from this meta-analysis found that inaccuracy and imprecision of continuous noninvasive arterial pressure monitoring devices are larger than what was defined as acceptable. This may have implications for clinical situations where continuous noninvasive arterial pressure is being used for patient care decisions. (­Anesthesiology 2014; 120:1080-97)},

Arterial BP can either be obtained invasively via an arterial catheter or non-invasively. Non-invasive BP measurement provides either intermittent or continuous readings. Most commonly, an occluding upper arm cuff is used for intermittent non-invasive monitoring. BP values are then obtained either manually (by auscultation of Korotkoff sounds or palpation) or automatically (e.g., by oscillometry). For continuous non-invasive BP monitoring, the volume clamp method or arterial applanation tonometry can be used. Both techniques enable the arterial waveform and BP values to be obtained continuously.

Continuous and non-invasive BP (NIBP) monitoring is currently gaining attention in the human health monitoring area due to its promising potentials in assessing the health status of an individual, enabled by machine learning (ML), for various purposes such as early prediction of disease and intervention treatment. This review presents the development of a non-invasive BP measuring tool called sphygmomanometer in brief, summarizes state-of-the-art NIBP sensors, and identifies extended works on continuous NIBP monitoring using commercial devices. Moreover, the NIBP predictive techniques including pulse arrival time, pulse transit time, pulse wave velocity, and ML are elaborated on the basis of bio-signals acquisition from these sensors. Additionally, the different BP values (systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure) of the various ML models adopted in several reported studies are compared in terms of the international validation standards developed by the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) for clinically-approved BP monitors. Finally, several challenges and possible solutions for the implementation and realization of continuous NIBP technology are addressed.},

  abstract   = {High blood pressure (BP) or hypertension is the single most crucial adjustable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and monitoring the arterial blood pressure (ABP) is an efficient way to detect and control the prevalence of the cardiovascular health of patients. Therefore, monitoring the regulation of BP during patients’ daily life plays a critical role in the ambulatory setting and the latest mobile health technology. In recent years, many studies have been conducted to explore the feasibility and performance of such techniques in the health care system. The ultimate aim of these studies is to find and develop an alternative to conventional BP monitoring by using cuff-less, easy-to-use, fast, and cost-effective devices for controlling and lowering the physical harm of CVDs to the human body. However, most of the current studies are at the prototype phase and face a range of issues and challenges to meet clinical standards. This review focuses on the description and analysis of the latest continuous and cuff-less methods along with their key challenges and barriers. Particularly, most advanced and standard technologies including pulse transit time (PTT), ultrasound, pulse arrival time (PAT), and machine learning are investigated. The accuracy, portability, and comfort of use of these technologies, and the ability to integrate to the wearable healthcare system are discussed. Finally, the future directions for further study are suggested.},

  abstract  = {Exploiting photoplethysmography signals (PPG) for non-invasive blood pressure (BP) measurement is interesting for various reasons. First, PPG can easily be measured using fingerclip sensors. Second, camera based approaches allow to derive remote PPG (rPPG) signals similar to PPG and therefore provide the opportunity for non-invasive measurements of BP. Various methods relying on machine learning techniques have recently been published. Performances are often reported as the mean average error (MAE) on the data which is problematic. This work aims to analyze the PPG- and rPPG based BP prediction error with respect to the underlying data distribution. First, we train established neural network (NN) architectures and derive an appropriate parameterization of input segments drawn from continuous PPG signals. Second, we use this parameterization to train NNs with a larger PPG dataset and carry out a systematic evaluation of the predicted blood pressure. The analysis revealed a strong systematic increase of the prediction error towards less frequent BP values across NN architectures. Moreover, we tested different train/test set split configurations which underpin the importance of a careful subject-aware dataset assignment to prevent overly optimistic results. Third, we use transfer learning to train the NNs for rPPG based BP prediction. The resulting performances are similar to the PPG-only case. Finally, we apply different personalization techniques and retrain our NNs with subject-specific data for both the PPG-only and rPPG case. Whilst the particular technique is less important, personalization reduces the prediction errors significantly.},

  abstract   = {Continuous measurement of blood pressure is crucial to the assessment of many medical conditions. However, the current clinical gold standard involving an arterial catheter, occluding cuff, and other invasive procedures are performed in hospital settings while home-based devices can provide only intermittent measurement and are not as reliable. Therefore, there is a signiﬁcant need for continuous non-invasive blood pressure (cNIBP) monitoring in the daily life. Pulse transit time (PTT)/pulse arrival time (PAT) - based blood pressure measurement has proven its potential to address this need. In this article, we present state-of-the-art devices and recent literature related to measurement technologies used in PTT/PAT - based methods for cNIBP monitoring. Various physiological signals which could be used to enable cNIBP in the home setting are categorized into two groups (i.e., proximal waveforms and distal waveforms) and are thoroughly discussed and compared. Given insightful analysis of these waveforms, we highlight their combinations to derive PTT/PAT values for BP measurement then discuss challenges presented from the cufﬂess and PTT/PAT - based nature of these devices. Finally, we conclude with future directions needed for home-based cNIBP adaptation and present societal broader impacts.},

  abstract  = {The measurement of blood pressure (BP) is critical to the treatment and management of many medical conditions. High blood pressure is associated with many chronic disease conditions, and is a major source of mortality and morbidity around the world. For outpatient care as well as general health monitoring, there is great interest in being able to accurately and frequently measure BP outside of a clinical setting, using mobile or wearable devices. One possible solution is photoplethysmography (PPG), which is most commonly used in pulse oximetry in clinical settings for measuring oxygen saturation. PPG technology is becoming more readily available, inexpensive, convenient, and easily integrated into portable devices. Recent advances include the development of smartphones and wearable devices that collect pulse oximeter signals. In this article, we review (i) the state-of-the-art and the literature related to PPG signals collected by pulse oximeters, (ii) various theoretical approaches that have been adopted in PPG BP measurement studies, and (iii) the potential of PPG measurement devices as a wearable application. Past studies on changes in PPG signals and BP are highlighted, and the correlation between PPG signals and BP are discussed. We also review the combined use of features extracted from PPG and other physiological signals in estimating BP. Although the technology is not yet mature, it is anticipated that in the near future, accurate, continuous BP measurements may be available from mobile and wearable devices given their vast potential.},

  abstract = {Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) provides valuable information for cardiovascular risk assessment. The present cuff-based devices are intrusive for longterm BP monitoring, whereas cuff-less BP measurement methods based on pulse transit time or multi-parameter are inferior in robustness and reliability by using electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram signals. This study examined a multi-sensor fusion-based platform and algorithm for systolic BP (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic BP (DBP) estimation. The proposed multisensor platform was comprised of one ECG sensor and two pulse pressure wave sensors for simultaneous signal collection. After extracting 35 features from the collected signals, a weakly supervised feature selection method was proposed for dimension reduction because the reference oscillometric technique-based BP are intermittent and can be redeemed as coarse-grained labels. BP models were then established using a multi-instance regression algorithm. A total of 85 participants including 17 hypertensive and 12 hypotensive patients were enrolled. Experimental results showed that the proposed approach exhibited good accuracy for diverse population with an estimation error of 1.62 ± 7.76 mmHg for SBP, 1.53 ± 6.03 mmHg for MAP, and 1.49 ± 5.52 for DBP, which complied with the association for the advancement of medical instrumentation standards in BP estimation. Moreover, the estimation accuracy is with random daily fluctuations rather than long-term degradation through a maximum two-month follow-up period indicated good robustness performance. These results suggest that the proposed approach is with high reliability and robustness and thus provides a novel insight for cuff-less BP measurement.},

  abstract  = {Recently a few methods have been proposed in the literature for non-invasive cuff-less estimation of systolic and diastolic blood pressures. One of the most prominent methods is to use the Pulse Transit Time (PTT). Although it is proven that PTT has a strong correlation with the systolic and diastolic blood pressures, this relation is highly dependent to each individuals physiological properties. Therefore, it requires per person calibration for accurate and reliable blood pressure estimation from PTT, which is a big drawback. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, a novel method is proposed for accurate and reliable estimation of blood pressure that is calibration-free. This goal is accomplished by extraction of several physiological parameters from Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal as well as utilizing signal processing and machine learning algorithms. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed method achieves grade B for the estimation of the diastolic blood pressure and grade C for the estimation of the mean arterial pressure under the standard British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocol.},

  abstract   = {Cardiovascular diseases are one of the most severe causes of mortality, taking a heavy toll of lives annually throughout the world. The continuous monitoring of blood pressure seems to be the most viable option, but this demands an invasive process, bringing about several layers of complexities. This motivates us to develop a method to predict the continuous arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveform through a non-invasive approach using photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. In addition we explore the advantage of deep learning as it would free us from sticking to ideally shaped PPG signals only, by making handcrafted feature computation irrelevant, which is a shortcoming of the existing approaches. Thus, we present, PPG2ABP, a deep learning based method, that manages to predict the continuous ABP waveform from the input PPG signal, with a mean absolute error of 4.604 mmHg, preserving the shape, magnitude and phase in unison. However, the more astounding success of PPG2ABP turns out to be that the computed values of DBP, MAP and SBP from the predicted ABP waveform outperforms the existing works under several metrics, despite that PPG2ABP is not explicitly trained to do so.},

In this work, we propose a motion artifact reduction methodology that is effective even in the case of severe subject movement. The methodology involves an enhanced preprocessing unit consisting of a motion detection unit (MDU), period estimation unit, and a Fourier series reconstruction unit. The MDU aids in identifying clean data frames versus those corrupted with motion artifacts. The period detection unit is used to determine the fundamental frequency of a corrupt frame. The Fourier series reconstruction unit reconstructs the final preprocessed signal. The reconstruction process primarily utilizes the spectrum variability of the pulse waveform. Preprocessed data are then fed to a magnitude- based frequency domain independent component analysis (FD-ICA) unit. This helps reduce motion artifacts present at the frequency components chosen for reconstruction. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed motion artifact reduction method. The efficacy of the technique is compared with time domain ICA and complex frequency domain ICA methods.},

  abstract   = {Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading oﬀ model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IOaware—accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15\% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3× speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4× speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classiﬁcation) and entirely new capabilities: the ﬁrst Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4\% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1\% accuracy).},
