	abstract = {In numerous classification problems, class distribution is not balanced. For example, positive examples are rare in the fields of disease diagnosis and credit card fraud detection. General machine learning methods are known to be suboptimal for such imbalanced classification. One popular solution is to balance training data by oversampling the underrepresented (or undersampling the overrepresented) classes before applying machine learning algorithms. However, despite its popularity, the effectiveness of sampling has not been rigorously and comprehensively evaluated. This study assessed combinations of seven sampling methods and eight machine learning classifiers (56 varieties in total) using 31 datasets with varying degrees of imbalance. We used the areas under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) as the performance measures. The AUPRC is known to be more informative for imbalanced classification than the AUROC. We observed that sampling significantly changed the performance of the classifier (paired t-tests P {\textless} 0.05) only for few cases (12.2\% in AUPRC and 10.0\% in AUROC). Surprisingly, sampling was more likely to reduce rather than improve the classification performance. Moreover, the adverse effects of sampling were more pronounced in AUPRC than in AUROC. Among the sampling methods, undersampling performed worse than others. Also, sampling was more effective for improving linear classifiers. Most importantly, we did not need sampling to obtain the optimal classifier for most of the 31 datasets. In addition, we found two interesting examples in which sampling significantly reduced AUPRC while significantly improving AUROC (paired t-tests P {\textless} 0.05). In conclusion, the applicability of sampling is limited because it could be ineffective or even harmful. Furthermore, the choice of the performance measure is crucial for decision making. Our results provide valuable insights into the effect and characteristics of sampling for imbalanced classification.},

	abstract = {Real-world data often exhibit imbalanced distributions, where certain target values have significantly fewer observations. Existing techniques for dealing with imbalanced data focus on targets with categorical indices, i.e., different classes. However, many tasks involve continuous targets, where hard boundaries between classes do not exist. We define Deep Imbalanced Regression (DIR) as learning from such imbalanced data with continuous targets, dealing with potential missing data for certain target values, and generalizing to the entire target range. Motivated by the intrinsic difference between categorical and continuous label space, we propose distribution smoothing for both labels and features, which explicitly acknowledges the effects of nearby targets, and calibrates both label and learned feature distributions. We curate and benchmark large-scale DIR datasets from common real-world tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and healthcare domains. Extensive experiments verify the superior performance of our strategies. Our work fills the gap in benchmarks and techniques for practical imbalanced regression problems.

	abstract = {The problem of imbalanced domains, framed within predictive tasks, is relevant in many practical applications. When dealing with imbalanced domains a performance degradation is usually observed on the most rare and relevant cases for the user. This problem has been thoroughly studied within a classification setting where the target variable is nominal. The exploration of this problem in other contexts is more recent within the research community. For regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous, only a few solutions exist. Pre-processing strategies are among the most successful proposals for tackling this problem. In this paper we propose a new pre-processing approach for dealing with imbalanced regression. Our algorithm, SMOGN, incorporates two existing proposals trying to solve problems detected in both of them. We show that SMOGN has advantages in comparison to other approaches. We also show that our method has a different impact on the learners used, displaying more advantages for Random Forest and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines learners.},

	abstract = {Ensemble methods are well known for providing an advantage over single models in a large range of data mining and machine learning tasks. Their benefits are commonly associated to the ability of reducing the bias and/or variance in learning tasks. Ensembles have been studied both for classification and regression tasks with uniform domain preferences. However, only for imbalanced classification these methods were thoroughly studied. In this paper we present an empirical study concerning the predictive ability of ensemble methods bagging and boosting in regression tasks, using 20 data sets with imbalanced distributions, and assuming non-uniform domain preferences. Results show that ensemble methods are capable of providing improvements in predictive ability towards under-represented values, and that this improvement influences the predictive ability of models concerning the average behaviour of the data. Results also show that the smaller data sets are prone to larger improvements in predictive accuracy and that no conclusion could be drawn when considering the percentage of rare cases alone.},

	abstract = {A photoplethysmogram (PPG) is a noninvasive circulatory signal related to the pulsatile volume of blood in tissue and is typically collected by pulse oximeters. PPG signals collected via mobile devices are prone to artifacts that negatively impact measurement accuracy, which can lead to a significant number of misleading diagnoses. Given the rapidly increased use of mobile devices to collect PPG signals, developing an optimal signal quality index (SQI) is essential to classify the signal quality from these devices. Eight SQIs were developed and tested based on: perfusion, kurtosis, skewness, relative power, non-stationarity, zero crossing, entropy, and the matching of systolic wave detectors. Two independent annotators annotated all PPG data (106 recordings, 60 s each) and a third expert conducted the adjudication of differences. The independent annotators labeled each PPG signal with one of the following labels: excellent, acceptable or unfit for diagnosis. All indices were compared using Mahalanobis distance, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and support vector machine with leave-one-out cross-validation. The skewness index outperformed the other seven indices in differentiating between excellent PPG and acceptable, acceptable combined with unfit, and unfit recordings, with overall     F 1     scores of 86.0\%, 87.2\%, and 79.1\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the detection of Parkinson’s disease based on the analysis of a patient’s gait. The growing popularity and success of Transformer networks in natural language processing and image recognition motivated us to develop a novel method for this problem based on an automatic features extraction via Transformers. The use of Transformers in 1D signal is not really widespread yet, but we show in this paper that they are effective in extracting relevant features from 1D signals. As Transformers require a lot of memory, we decoupled temporal and spatial information to make the model smaller. Our architecture used temporal Transformers, dimension reduction layers to reduce the dimension of the data, a spatial Transformer, two fully connected layers and an output layer for the ﬁnal prediction. Our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithm with 95.2\% accuracy in distinguishing a Parkinsonian patient from a healthy one on the Physionet dataset. A key learning from this work is that Transformers allow for greater stability in results. The source code and pre-trained models are released in https://github.com/DucMinhDimitriNguyen 1.},

However, in time series modeling, we are to extract the temporal relations in an ordered set of continuous points.

To this regard, we propose the convolution-augmented transformer for speech recognition, named Conformer.

When this variable is nominal, we have a problem of class imbalance that was thoroughly studied within machine learning. For regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous, few works exist addressing this type of problem. Still, important applications involve forecasting rare extreme values of a continuous target variable. This paper describes a contribution to this type of tasks. Namely, we propose to address such tasks by resampling approaches that change the distribution of the given data set to decrease the problem of imbalance between the rare target cases and the most frequent ones. We present two modiﬁcations of well-known resampling strategies for classiﬁcation tasks: the under-sampling and the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) methods. These modiﬁcations allow the use of these strategies on regression tasks where the goal is to forecast rare extreme values of the target variable. In an extensive set of experiments, we provide empirical evidence for the superiority of our proposals for these particular regression tasks. The proposed resampling methods can be used with any existing regression algorithm, which means that they are general tools for addressing problems of forecasting rare extreme values of a continuous target variable.},

	abstract = {Deep Learning has revolutionized vision via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and natural language processing via recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, success stories of Deep Learning with standard feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) are rare. FNNs that perform well are typically shallow and, therefore cannot exploit many levels of abstract representations. We introduce self-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) to enable high-level abstract representations. While batch normalization requires explicit normalization, neuron activations of SNNs automatically converge towards zero mean and unit variance. The activation function of SNNs are “scaled exponential linear units” (SELUs), which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach ﬁxed-point theorem, we prove that activations close to zero mean and unit variance that are propagated through many network layers will converge towards zero mean and unit variance — even under the presence of noise and perturbations. This convergence property of SNNs allows to (1) train deep networks with many layers, (2) employ strong regularization schemes, and (3) to make learning highly robust. Furthermore, for activations not close to unit variance, we prove an upper and lower bound on the variance, thus, vanishing and exploding gradients are impossible. We compared SNNs on (a) 121 tasks from the UCI machine learning repository, on (b) drug discovery benchmarks, and on (c) astronomy tasks with standard FNNs, and other machine learning methods such as random forests and support vector machines. For FNNs we considered (i) ReLU networks without normalization, (ii) batch normalization, (iii) layer normalization, (iv) weight normalization, (v) highway networks, and (vi) residual networks. SNNs signiﬁcantly outperformed all competing FNN methods at 121 UCI tasks, outperformed all competing methods at the Tox21 dataset, and set a new record at an astronomy data set. The winning SNN architectures are often very deep. Implementations are available at: github.com/bioinf-jku/SNNs.},

Firstly, we tried to identify the model considering arterial blood pressure (ABP) as input and PPG as output, and we achieved an average estimation accuracy (normalized root mean square, NRMSE) of 84.4\%. Next, we fitted an inverse model, where ABP is the output, and PPG is the input, and we achieved an average estimation accuracy (NRMSE) of 84.7\%. Finallly, We verified that the two identified models mentioned above are inverse of each other. In this study, we have used ABP and PPG signals of 10 (male = 7, female = 3) subjets from the MIMIC II database.

	abstract = {Often we wish to predict a large number of variables that depend on each other as well as on other observed variables. Structured prediction methods are essentially a combination of classiﬁcation and graphical modeling, combining the ability of graphical models to compactly model multivariate data with the ability of classiﬁcation methods to perform prediction using large sets of input features. This tutorial describes conditional random ﬁelds, a popular probabilistic method for structured prediction. CRFs have seen wide application in natural language processing, computer vision, and bioinformatics. We describe methods for inference and parameter estimation for CRFs, including practical issues for implementing large scale CRFs. We do not assume previous knowledge of graphical modeling, so this tutorial is intended to be useful to practitioners in a wide variety of ﬁelds.},

It explained aortic pressure decay in diastole, but fell short in systole. Therefore characteristic impedance was introduced as a third element of the Windkessel model. Characteristic impedance links the lumped Windkessel to transmission phenomena (e.g., wave travel). Windkessels are used as hydraulic load for isolated hearts and in studies of the entire circulation. Furthermore, they are used to estimate total arterial compliance from pressure and flow; several of these methods are reviewed. Windkessels describe the general features of the input impedance, with physiologically interpretable parameters. Since it is a lumped model it is not suitable for the assessment of spatially distributed phenomena and aspects of wave travel, but it is a simple and fairly accurate approximation of ventricular afterload.},

While there have been remarkable improvements in cardiac arrhythmia classification methods, they still cannot offer acceptable performance in detecting different heart conditions, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. In this paper, we propose a solution to address this limitation of current classification approaches by developing an automatic heartbeat classification method using deep convolutional neural networks and sequence to sequence models. We evaluated the proposed method on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, considering the intra-patient and inter-patient paradigms, and the AAMI EC57 standard. The evaluation results for both paradigms show that our method achieves the best performance in the literature (a positive predictive value of 96.46\% and sensitivity of 100\% for the category S, and a positive predictive value of 98.68\% and sensitivity of 97.40\% for the category F for the intra-patient scheme; a positive predictive value of 92.57\% and sensitivity of 88.94\% for the category S, and a positive predictive value of 99.50\% and sensitivity of 99.94\% for the category V for the inter-patient scheme.).

However, due to the varying environments in which wearable devices are used and, consequently, their varying susceptibility to noise interference, effective processing of PPG signals is challenging. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the optimal filter and filter order to be used for PPG signal processing to make the systolic and diastolic waves more salient in the filtered PPG signal using the skewness quality index. Nine types of filters with 10 different orders were used to filter 219 (2.1s) short PPG signals. The signals were divided into three categories by PPG experts according to their noise levels: excellent, acceptable, or unfit. Results show that the Chebyshev II filter can improve the PPG signal quality more effectively than other types of filters and that the optimal order for the Chebyshev II filter is the 4th order.},

However, processing PPG signals measured after exercise is challenging, especially if the environment is hot and humid. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that can detect systolic peaks under challenging conditions, as in the case of emergency responders in tropical conditions. Accurate systolic-peak detection is an important first step for the analysis of heart rate variability. Algorithms based on local maxima-minima, first-derivative, and slope sum are evaluated, and a new algorithm is introduced to improve the detection rate. With 40 healthy subjects, the new algorithm demonstrates the highest overall detection accuracy (99.84\% sensitivity, 99.89\% positive predictivity). Existing algorithms, such as Billauer’s, Li’s and Zong’s, have comparable although lower accuracy. However, the proposed algorithm presents an advantage for real-time applications by avoiding human intervention in threshold determination. For best performance, we show that a combination of two event-related moving averages with an offset threshold has an advantage in detecting systolic peaks, even in heat-stressed PPG signals.},

	abstract = {Objective: The photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, commonly used in the healthcare settings, is easily affected by movement artefact leading to errors in the extracted heart rate and SpO2 estimates. This study aims to develop an online artefact detection system based on adaptive (dynamic) template matching, suitable for continuous PPG monitoring during daily living activities or in the intensive care units (ICUs). Approach: Several master templates are initially generated by applying principal component analysis to data obtained from the PhysioNet MIMIC II database. The master template is then updated with each incoming clean PPG pulse. The correlation coefficient is used to classify the PPG pulse into either good or bad quality categories. The performance of our algorithm was evaluated using data obtained from two different sources: (i) our own data collected from 19 healthy subjects using the wearable Sotera Visi Mobile system (Sotera Wireless Inc.) as they performed various movement types; and (ii) ICU data provided by the PhysioNet MIMIC II database. The developed algorithm was evaluated against a manually annotated ‘gold standard’ (GS). Main results: Our algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of 91.5\% ± 2.9\%, with a sensitivity of 94.1\% ± 2.7\% and a specificity of 89.7\% ± 5.1\%, when tested on our own data. When applying the algorithm to data from the PhysioNet MIMIC II database, it achieved an accuracy of 98.0\%, with a sensitivity and specificity of 99.0\% and 96.1\%, respectively. Significance: The proposed method is simple and robust against individual variations in the PPG characteristics, thus making it suitable for a diverse range of datasets. Integration of the proposed artefact detection technique into remote monitoring devices could enhance reliability of the PPG-derived physiological parameters.},

Draft standards are made available for public review and may become American national standards after review by the American National Standards Institute. The first American national standard for electronic and automated sphygmomanometers was published in monograph form in 1987. The objective of the revised 1992 standard for electronic and automated sphygmomanometers is to provide updated labeling, safety, and performance requirements that help ensure that consumers and health care professionals are supplied with safe, accurate devices for the indirect measurement of blood pressure, including ambulatory blood pressure recorders. This standard permits validation of the automatic or electronic device by comparison with either direct, intra-arterial blood pressure measurements or the noninvasive cuff/stethoscope technique, based on Korotkoff sounds identified by individuals trained in auscultation. This summary report of the 1992 American national standard for automatic sphygmomanometers provides recommendations for the methods of comparison, statistical analysis of the data, presentation of the results, and criteria for acceptability.

Leveraging two robust data warehouses, the Perioperative DataMart and the Mayo Clinic Life Silences System, the authors cross-matched arterial line cannulation with a documented vascular consult, neurologic consult, infection, or return to surgery within 30 days in order to identify the initial patient population.A total of 62,626 arterial lines were placed in 57,787 patients, and 90.1\% of the catheters placed were 20-gauge catheters. The radial artery was cannulated in 94.5\% of patients. A total of 21 patients were identified as having experienced vascular complications or nerve injuries, resulting in a complication rate of 3.4 per 10,000 (95\% CI, 2.1 to 5.1). Cardiac surgery had the largest number of catheters placed (n = 15,419) with 12 complications (complication rate = 7.8 per 10,000; 95\% CI, 4.0 to 13.6). The rate of complications differed significantly (P \&lt; 0.001) across the three most common catheter sizes (2.7 per 10,000 [95\% CI, 1.5 to 4.4] for 20 gauge, 17.2 per 10,000 [95\% CI, 4.7 to 43.9] for 18 gauge, and 9.4 per 10,000 [95\% CI, 1.1 to 34.1] for 5 French).In a large retrospective study, the authors document a very low rate of complications with arterial line placement.In a series of 57,787 patients receiving arterial cannulation, 21 patients were identified as having experienced vascular complications or nerve injuries, resulting in a very low complication rate of 3.4/10,000. The rate of complications differed significantly (P \&lt; 0.001) across the three most common catheter sizes (2.7/10,000 for 20 gauge, 17.2/10,000 for 18 gauge, and 9.4/10,000 for 5 French).

	abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple and low-cost optical technique that can be used to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. It is often used non-invasively to make measurements at the skin surface. The PPG waveform comprises a pulsatile (‘AC’) physiological waveform attributed to cardiac synchronous changes in the blood volume with each heart beat, and is superimposed on a slowly varying (‘DC’) baseline with various lower frequency components attributed to respiration, sympathetic nervous system activity and thermoregulation. Although the origins of the components of the PPG signal are not fully understood, it is generally accepted that they can provide valuable information about the cardiovascular system. There has been a resurgence of interest in the technique in recent years, driven by the demand for low cost, simple and portable technology for the primary care and community based clinical settings, the wide availability of low cost and small semiconductor components, and the advancement of computer-based pulse wave analysis techniques. The PPG technology has been used in a wide range of commercially available medical devices for measuring oxygen saturation, blood pressure and cardiac output, assessing autonomic function and also detecting peripheral vascular disease. The introductory sections of the topical review describe the basic principle of operation and interaction of light with tissue, early and recent history of PPG, instrumentation, measurement protocol, and pulse wave analysis. The review then focuses on the applications of PPG in clinical physiological measurements, including clinical physiological monitoring, vascular assessment and autonomic function.},

	abstract = {Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) and photoplethysmography (PPG) are both useful techniques to monitor cardiovascular status. Though ABP monitoring is more widely employed, this procedure of signal acquisition whether done invasively or non-invasively may cause inconvenience and discomfort to the patients. PPG, however, is simple, noninvasive, and can be used for continuous measurement. This paper focuses on analyzing the similarities in time and frequency domains between ABP and PPG signals for normotensive, prehypertensive and hypertensive subjects and the feasibility of the classification of subjects considering the results of the analysis performed. From a database with 120 records of ABP and PPG, each 120 s in length, the records where separated into epochs taking into account 10 heartbeats, and the following statistical measures were performed: Correlation (r), Coherence (COH), Partial Coherence (pCOH), Partial Directed Coherence (PDC), Directed Transfer Function (DTF), Full Frequency Directed Transfer Function (ffDTF) and Direct Directed Transfer Function (dDTF). The correlation coefficient was     r {\textgreater} 0.9     on average for all groups, indicating a strong morphology similarity. For COH and pCOH, coherence (linear correlation in frequency domain) was found with significance (p {\textless} 0.01) in differentiating between normotensive and hypertensive subjects using PPG signals. For the dataset at hand, only two synchrony measures are able to convincingly distinguish hypertensive subjects from normotensive control subjects, i.e., ffDTF and dDTF. From PDC, DTF, ffDTF, and dDTF, a consistent, a strong significant causality from ABP→PPG was found. When all synchrony measures were combined, an     87.5 \%     accuracy was achieved to detect hypertension using a Neural Network classifier, suggesting that PPG holds most informative features that exist in ABP.},
