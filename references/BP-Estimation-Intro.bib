Intraoperative blood pressure is measured frequently, but blood pressure on surgical wards is usually measured only every 4 to 6 h, leaving long intervals during which hypotension and hypertension may be undetected. This study evaluated the incidence and severity of postoperative hypotension and hypertension in adults recovering from abdominal surgery and the extent to which serious perturbations were missed by routine vital-sign assessments.Blood pressure was recorded at 1-min intervals during the initial 48 h in adults recovering from abdominal surgery using a continuous noninvasive monitor. Caregivers were blinded to these measurements and depended on routine vital-sign assessments. Hypotension and hypertension were characterized as time under and above various mean arterial pressure thresholds.Of 502 available patients, 312 patients with high-quality records were analyzed, with a median measurement time of 48 [interquartile range: 41, 48] postoperative hours. Nearly a quarter experienced an episode of mean arterial pressure of less than 70 mm Hg lasting at least 30 min (24\%; 95\% CI, 20\%, 29\%), and 18\% had an episode of mean arterial pressure of less than 65 mm Hg lasting at least 15 min. Nearly half the patients who had mean arterial pressure of less than 65 mm Hg for at least 15 min (47\%; 95\% CI, 34\%, 61\%) were undetected by routine vital-sign assessments. Episodes of mean arterial pressure greater than 110 mm Hg lasting at least 30 min were observed in 42\% (95\% CI, 37\%, 48\%) of patients; 7\% had mean arterial pressure greater than 130 mm Hg for at least 30 min, 96\% of which were missed by routine assessments. Episodes of mean arterial pressure less than 65 mm Hg and mean arterial pressure greater than 110 mm Hg captured by routine vital-sign assessments but not by continuous monitoring occurred in 34 and 8 patients, respectively.Postoperative hypotension and hypertension were common, prolonged, profound, and largely undetected by routine vital-sign assessments in a cohort of adults recovering from abdominal surgery. Frequent or continuous blood pressure monitoring may detect hemodynamic perturbations more effectively and potentially facilitate treatment.},

  abstract = {Background
              Intraoperative mortality is now rare, but death within 30 days of surgery remains surprisingly common. Perioperative myocardial infarction is associated with a remarkably high mortality. There are strong associations between hypotension and myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, renal injury, and death. Perioperative arterial blood pressure management was thus the basis of a Perioperative Quality Initiative consensus-building conference held in London in July 2017.
              Methods
              The meeting featured a modified Delphi process in which groups addressed various aspects of perioperative arterial pressure.
              Results
              Three consensus statements on intraoperative blood pressure were established. 1) Intraoperative mean arterial pressures below 60–70 mm Hg are associated with myocardial injury, acute kidney injury, and death. Injury is a function of hypotension severity and duration. 2) For adult non-cardiac surgical patients, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a general upper limit of arterial pressure at which therapy should be initiated, although pressures above 160 mm Hg have been associated with myocardial injury and infarction. 3) During cardiac surgery, intraoperative systolic arterial pressure above 140 mm Hg is associated with increased 30 day mortality. Injury is a function of arterial pressure severity and duration.
              Conclusions
              There is increasing evidence that even brief durations of systolic arterial pressure {\textless}100 mm Hg and mean arterial pressure {\textless}60–70 mm Hg are harmful during non-cardiac surgery.},

  abstract = {Although deviations in intraoperative blood pressure are assumed to be associated with postoperative mortality, critical blood pressure thresholds remain undefined. Therefore, the authors estimated the intraoperative thresholds of systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean blood pressure (MAP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) associated with increased risk-adjusted 30-day mortality.This retrospective cohort study combined intraoperative blood pressure data from six Veterans Affairs medical centers with 30-day outcomes to determine the risk-adjusted associations between intraoperative blood pressure and 30-day mortality. Deviations in blood pressure were assessed using three methods: (1) population thresholds (individual patient sum of area under threshold [AUT] or area over threshold 2 SDs from the mean of the population intraoperative blood pressure values), (2). absolute thresholds, and (3) percent change from baseline blood pressure.Thirty-day mortality was associated with (1) population threshold: systolic AUT (odds ratio, 3.3; 95\% CI, 2.2 to 4.8), mean AUT (2.8; 1.9 to 4.3), and diastolic AUT (2.4; 1.6 to 3.8). Approximate conversions of AUT into its separate components of pressure and time were SBP \&lt; 67 mmHg for more than 8.2 min, MAP \&lt; 49 mmHg for more than 3.9 min, DBP \&lt; 33 mmHg for more than 4.4 min. (2) Absolute threshold: SBP \&lt; 70 mmHg for more than or equal to 5 min (odds ratio, 2.9; 95\% CI, 1.7 to 4.9), MAP \&lt; 49 mmHg for more than or equal to 5 min (2.4; 1.3 to 4.6), and DBP \&lt; 30 mmHg for more than or equal to 5 min (3.2; 1.8 to 5.5). (3) Percent change: MAP decreases to more than 50\% from baseline for more than or equal to 5 min (2.7; 1.5 to 5.0). Intraoperative hypertension was not associated with 30-day mortality with any of these techniques.Intraoperative hypotension, but not hypertension, is associated with increased 30-day operative mortality.},

  abstract = {Average mean arterial pressure and mean pressure variability were nonlinearly related to 30-day mortality in noncardiac surgical patients. After adjusting for time-weighted average mean arterial pressure and other important covariables, low blood pressure variability as measured by an improved formula was still associated with higher 30-day mortality, but the differences were not clinically important. Anesthesiologists might thus pay more attention to overall trends in the mean blood pressure for a case than in the minute-to-minute variation.Little is known about the relationship between intraoperative blood pressure variability and mortality after noncardiac surgery. Therefore, the authors tested the hypothesis that blood pressure variability, independent from absolute blood pressure, is associated with increased 30-day mortality.Baseline and intraoperative variables plus 30-day mortality were obtained for 104,401 adults having noncardiac surgery lasting 60 min or longer. In confounder-adjusted models, the authors evaluated the associations between 30-day mortality and both time-weighted average intraoperative mean arterial pressure (TWA-MAP) and measures of intraoperative MAP variability—including generalized average real variability of MAP (ARV-MAP) and SD of MAP (SD-MAP).Mean ± SD TWA-MAP was 84 ± 10 mmHg, and ARV-MAP was 2.5 ± 1.3 mmHg/min. TWA-MAP was strongly related to 30-day mortality, which more than tripled as TWA-MAP decreased from 80 to 50 mmHg. ARV-MAP was only marginally related to 30-day mortality (P = 0.033) after adjusting for TWA-MAP. Compared with median ARV-MAP, odds ratio (95\% CI) for 30-day mortality was 1.14 (1.03 to 1.25) for low ARV-MAP (first quartile) and 0.94 (0.88 to 0.99) for high ARV-MAP (third quartile). Odds of 30-day mortality decreased as five-level categorized ARV-MAP increased (0.92; 0.87 to 0.99 for one category increase; P = 0.015). Secondarily, cumulative duration of MAP less than 50, 55, 60, 70, and 80 mmHg was associated with increased odds of 30-day mortality (all P \&lt; 0.001).Although lower mean arterial pressure is strongly associated with mortality, lower intraoperative blood pressure variability per se is only mildly associated with postoperative mortality after noncardiac surgery.},

We determined the association between hypotension and a composite of 30-day myocardial infarction and death over three periods: (1) intraoperative, (2) remaining day of surgery, and (3) during the initial four postoperative days.This was a substudy of POISE-2, a 10,010-patient factorial-randomized trial of aspirin and clonidine for prevention of myocardial infarction. Clinically important hypotension was defined as systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg requiring treatment. Minutes of hypotension was the exposure variable intraoperatively and for the remaining day of surgery, whereas hypotension status was treated as binary variable for postoperative days 1 to 4. We estimated the average relative effect of hypotension across components of the composite using a distinct effect generalized estimating model, adjusting for hypotension during earlier periods.Among 9,765 patients, 42\% experienced hypotension, 590 (6.0\%) had an infarction, and 116 (1.2\%) died within 30 days of surgery. Intraoperatively, the estimated average relative effect across myocardial infarction and mortality was 1.08 (98.3\% CI, 1.03, 1.12; P \&lt; 0.001) per 10-min increase in hypotension duration. For the remaining day of surgery, the odds ratio was 1.03 (98.3\% CI, 1.01, 1.05; P \&lt; 0.001) per 10-min increase in hypotension duration. The average relative effect odds ratio was 2.83 (98.3\% CI, 1.26, 6.35; P = 0.002) in patients with hypotension during the subsequent four days of hospitalization.Clinically important hypotension—a potentially modifiable exposure—was significantly associated with a composite of myocardial infarction and death during each of three perioperative periods, even after adjustment for previous hypotension.},

  abstract = {Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) may be associated with postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI), but the duration of hypotension for triggering harm is unclear. The authors investigated the association between varying periods of IOH with mean arterial pressure (MAP) less than 55, less than 60, and less than 65 mmHg with AKI.The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of 5,127 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery (2009 to 2012) with invasive MAP monitoring and length of stay of 1 or more days. Exclusion criteria were preoperative MAP less than 65 mmHg, dialysis dependence, urologic surgery, and surgical duration less than 30 min. The primary exposure was IOH. The primary outcome was AKI (50\% or 0.3 mg/dl increase in creatinine) during the first 2 postoperative days. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model the exposure–outcome relationship.AKI occurred in 324 (6.3\%) patients and was associated with MAP less than 60 mmHg for 11 to 20 min and MAP less than 55 mmHg for more than 10 min in a graded fashion. The adjusted odds ratio of AKI for MAP less than 55 mmHg was 2.34 (1.35 to 4.05) for 11- to 20-min exposure and 3.53 (1.51 to 8.25) for more than 20 min. For MAP less than 60 mmHg, the adjusted odds ratio for AKI was 1.84 (1.11 to 3.06) for 11- to 20-min exposure.In this analysis, postoperative AKI is associated with sustained intraoperative periods of MAP less than 55 and less than 60 mmHg. This study provides an impetus for clinical trials to determine whether interventions that promptly treat IOH and are tailored to individual patient physiology could help reduce the risk of AKI.In a retrospective study of 5,127 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, an increased risk of postoperative acute kidney injury (defined as \&gt;50\% or 0.3 mg/dl increase in serum creatinine concentration) was found when intraoperative mean arterial pressure was less than 60 mmHg for more than 20 min and less than 55 mmHg for more than 10 min.Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text.},

Thus, the authors assessed the relationship between myocardial and kidney injury and intraoperative absolute (mean arterial pressure [MAP]) and relative (reduction from preoperative pressure) MAP thresholds.The authors characterized hypotension by the lowest MAP below various absolute and relative thresholds for cumulative 1, 3, 5, or 10 min and also time-weighted average below various absolute or relative MAP thresholds. The authors modeled each relationship using logistic regression. The authors further evaluated whether the relationships between intraoperative hypotension and either myocardial or kidney injury depended on baseline MAP. Finally, the authors compared the strength of associations between absolute and relative thresholds on myocardial and kidney injury using C statistics.MAP below absolute thresholds of 65 mmHg or relative thresholds of 20\% were progressively related to both myocardial and kidney injury. At any given threshold, prolonged exposure was associated with increased odds. There were no clinically important interactions between preoperative blood pressures and the relationship between hypotension and myocardial or kidney injury at intraoperative mean arterial blood pressures less than 65 mmHg. Absolute and relative thresholds had comparable ability to discriminate patients with myocardial or kidney injury from those without.The associations based on relative thresholds were no stronger than those based on absolute thresholds. Furthermore, there was no clinically important interaction with preoperative pressure. Anesthetic management can thus be based on intraoperative pressures without regard to preoperative pressure.},

The authors evaluated the association between intraoperative MAP from less than 55 to 75 mmHg and postoperative AKI and myocardial injury to determine the threshold of MAP where risk is increased. The authors then evaluated the association between the duration below this threshold and their outcomes adjusting for potential confounding variables.AKI and myocardial injury developed in 2,478 (7.4\%) and 770 (2.3\%) surgeries, respectively. The MAP threshold where the risk for both outcomes increased was less than 55 mmHg. Compared with never developing a MAP less than 55 mmHg, those with a MAP less than 55 mmHg for 1–5, 6–10, 11–20, and more than 20 min had graded increases in their risk of the two outcomes (AKI: 1.18 [95\% CI, 1.06–1.31], 1.19 [1.03–1.39], 1.32 [1.11–1.56], and 1.51 [1.24–1.84], respectively; myocardial injury 1.30 [1.06–1.5], 1.47 [1.13–1.93], 1.79 [1.33–2.39], and 1.82 [1.31–2.55], respectively].Even short durations of an intraoperative MAP less than 55 mmHg are associated with AKI and myocardial injury.

We closely examined the three most commonly used arterial cannulation sites. The reviewed papers included a total of 19,617 radial, 3899 femoral and 1989 axillary artery catheterizations. Factors that contribute to higher complication rates were investigated. Major complications occurred in fewer than 1\% of the cases, and rates were similar for the radial, femoral and axillary arteries. We conclude that arterial cannulation is a safe procedure.},
